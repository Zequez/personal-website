    ## 🏃 Experience

    Granted, I don't have a long track records of working on long term projects
    in companies; but I've been creating on the web since 2008 and got my first
    real job on 2011.

    To me this has been always more a tool to satisfy my mental need of inventing stuff
    than a career, and as such most of my effort has been working on side projects
    than on paid work.

    ### Backend or frontend?

    I enjoy frontend work more; I like the visual interactive stuff.
    I believe the backend is gonna be deprecrated by Holochain.

    ## 💎 What I value in work

    - I value being able to work fully remote
    - I value being given a challenge to do on my own time that is already making a contribution, rather than an extensive technical interview or tests
    - I value a compensation of at least $30/h, and I'm flexible in terms of payment schedule
    - I value autonomy and experimental environments where outcomes are less important than learning and innovation
    - I value activities that resonate with me and my vision of the future; I value purposeful work that goes beyond just making money to survive
    - I value flexible workweeks (which can include weekends) of about 20hs per week because they work well with the way I'm parenting my son
    - I value treating each other and being treated as a whole human being first, and bring our whole resources as people to the team rather than become strictly our technical abilities. Being kind to each other, understanding, giving support and creating possibilities for all areas of our lives.
