      ## üíé Personal values

      I've only recently started to inquire myself about my values. So far the following is what I most resonate with:

      - Forgiveness
      - Honesty
      - Curiosity
      - Peace
      - Collaboration

      I won't elaborate further for now.

      ## üß† Beliefs

      I exist; I'm alive. That's as far as my certainty goes from personal experience.

      Beyond personal experience I've adopted beliefs from knowledge I read that
      somehow makes sense, resonates with me or proves to be useful.

      - I'm having a temporary human experience on planet Earth through time
      - I agreed to voluntary amnesia
      - There is reason for this journey; likely to learn something from an experience
      - I cannot know who I am with my mind; and cannot conceive or transmit my beingness aside from the experience of being present
      - I'm an individual being different from God but also part of God.
      - God is a different person than me and I can relate to God in an intimate way as I relate to other human beings.
      - God is benevolant, listens to me, provides me with what I ask for, and wants me to be happy.
      - There are beings on subtler dimensions that are constantly looking after us beyond our conscious awareness.
      - Service to God is my constitutional position, as a hand is to serve the whole body.
      - All belief is a mental concept that covers up an ineffable part of an unknown truth that produces fear to look at.
      - In this human experience I have a box, an ego, a personality, that I use to interact with the world. It's like a spaceship perfectly equipped to my mission on this run.
      - I have 5 bodies: Intellectual, Physical, Emotional, Energetic, Archetypal
      - I have multiple ego states one which is adult, and others made up of childhood survival strategies
      - Through certain processes can glimpse into a dimension of stillness and spaciousness; that's always available to me and I can practice accessing and staying there.
      - The mind is a complex programmable tool with the purpose of serving me
      - Transformation happens through experience on my bodies, not only with intellectual understanding
      - I'm radically responsible for everything in my life; irresponsibility is an illusion, a survival strategy of the ego to play victim.

      ## ü´∂ Movements I resonate with

      - Cooperativism
      - Veganism / Ahimsa
      - Open Source / Copyleft
      - [Archiarchy](/writing/arquiarquia-y-otras-distinciones) (the culture)

      ## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Current role model for a highly functional adult

      [Clinton Callahan](https://www.clintoncallahan.org/)

      If there was a ranking list of incredibleness for every person on the planet that I know,
      Clinton Callahan would be at the top. My box maintains the list and puts him on a pedestal.

      Whatever I hear from him or watch him do, has a profound effect on my belief system.

      It is at it is; I don't know why. I don't consider this to be good or bad; it's just something
      I notice about the way I see Clinton Callahan.

      ## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Life situation

      - I'm currently coming to terms with the need to survive and gather money
      on modern culture in planet Earth.
      - I have a son, Coral, almost 3.
      - I'm wrestling with problematic use of Internet, streaming and videogames
      - I'm living separate from the mother of my son; my son stays with me half the week.
      - The way I'm living, I consider that I need about $500 per month to satisfy the basic survival needs of the body
      - I have about $3500 in debt that I want to pay back

      ## üëª Personality Traits

      - I have tons of ideas all the time; I seldom put them in practice
      - I often make promises I don't fulfill trying to prove myself
      - I have pride and insecurities that make it hard for myself to find work I'm willing to do
      - I like dancing, making music and singing; I'm afraid to do it in public
      - I crave working and being part of a team; I'm afraid of connection and being rejected
      - Was vegan for 4 years and now I'm a more flexible vegetarian; still vegan at home but not dogmatic about it
