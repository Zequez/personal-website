    ## Personal values

    I've only recently started to inquire myself about my values. So far the following is what I most resonate with:

    - Forgiveness
    - Honesty
    - Curiosity
    - Peace
    - Collaboration

    I won't elaborate further for now.

    ## Beliefs

    I exist; I'm alive. That's as far as my certainty goes from personal experience.

    Beyond personal experience I've adopted beliefs from knowledge I read that
    somehow makes sense, resonates with me or proves to be useful.

    - I'm having a temporary human experience on planet Earth through time
    - I agreed to voluntary amnesia
    - There is reason for this journey; likely to learn something from an experience
    - I cannot know who I am with my mind; and cannot conceive or transmit my beingness aside from the experience of being present
    - I'm an individual being different from God but als part of God.
    - God is a different person than me and I can relate to God in an intimate way as I relate to other human beings.
    - God is benevolant, gives me what I ask for, and wants me to be happy.
    - There are beings on subtler dimensions that are constantly looking after us beyond our conscious awareness.
    - Service to God is my constitutional position, as a hand is to serve the whole body.
    - All belief is a mental concept that covers up an ineffable part of an unknown truth that produces fear to look at.
    - In this human experience I have a box, an ego, a personality, that I use to interact with the world. It's like a spaceship perfectly equipped to my mission on this run.
    - I have 5 bodies: Intellectual, Physical, Emotional, Energetic, Archetypal
    - I have multiple ego states one which is adult, and others made up of survival strategies
    - Through certain processes can glimpse into a dimension of stillness and spaciousness; that's always available to me and I can practice accessing and staying there.
    - The mind is a complex programmable tool with the purpose of serving me
    - Transformation happens through experience on my bodies, not only with intellectual understanding
    - I'm radically responsible for everything in my life; irresponsibility is an illusion, a survival strategy of the ego to play victim.

    ## Movements I resonate with

    - Cooperativism
    - Veganism / Ahimsa
    - Open Source / Copyleft

    ## Current role model for a highly functional adult

    [Clinton Callahan](https://www.clintoncallahan.org/)

    If there was a ranking list of incredibleness for every person on the planet that I know,
    Clinton Callahan would be at the top. My box maintains the list and puts him on a pedestal.

    Whatever I hear from him or watch him do, has a profound effect on my belief system.

    It is at it is; I don't know why. I don't consider this to be good or bad; it's just something
    I notice about the way I see Clinton Callahan.

    ## Life situation

    - I'm currently coming to terms with the need to survive and gather money
    on modern culture in planet Earth.
    - I have a son, Coral, almost 3.
    - I'm wrestling with problematic use of Internet, streaming and videogames
    - I'm living separate from the mother of my son; my son stays with me half the week.
    - The way I'm living, I consider that I need about $500 per month to satisfy the basic survival needs of the body
    - I have about $3500 in debt that I want to pay back

    ## Personality Traits

    - I have tons of ideas all the time; I seldom put them in practice
    - I often make promises I don't fulfill trying to prove myself
    - I have pride and insecurities that make it hard for myself to find work I'm willing to do
    - I like dancing, making music and singing; I'm afraid to do it in public
    - I crave working and being part of a team; I'm afraid of connection and being rejected
    - Was vegan for 4 years and now I'm a more flexible vegetarian; still vegan at home but not dogmatic about it
