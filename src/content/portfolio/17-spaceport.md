description: My alternative take on the Spaceport for StartOver.xyz; mostly an experiment to try out creating the navigation style of Niagara Launcher. I didn't quite finish porting all the data and maintaining it.

[StartOver.xyz](http://startover.xyz) is a free-to-play massively-multiplayer online-and-offline matrix-building thoughtware-upgrade personal-transformation real-life adventure-game created and maintained by the [General Memetics team](https://generalmemetics.mystrikingly.com/).

The [original SpacePort](http://spaceport.mystrikingly.com) is a catalog of all the websites in StartOver. It's sort of a central hub of the whole thing, and personally the most used page.

Most of the pages in StartOver are built with the free [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/) website builder. The SpacePort page is so huge, and the Strikingly websites so poorly optimized, that the page usually freezes my phone, and often my computer. I also find it difficult to navigate and I imagine maintenance must not be a cakewalk either, since Strikingly was not designed to create something like StartOver.

I often imagined a different SpacePort experience and I never quite comitted myself to create it. Until now.

It's a work in progress.
