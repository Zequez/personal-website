description: A template-based HTML email signature generator I built by request of a client. It generates an HTML you then paste into Gmail or other email systems.
status: Archived

I built this for a client initially. They wanted to generate an HTML email signature based on a design. Turns out you gotta copy the signature as HTML and then paste it on Gmail or other email systems. The whole thing is quite convoluted.

Anyway. The system I built allows you to set a template for the signature, and on the template you define the configurable text, images, links, etc. Then it generates a UI to configure the signature. Right now there are just 2 templates only.

For the images it needs you to upload them somewhere else and paste the URL, because it's built entirely as a static app and does not have a backend or any way to upload files. Not that it cannot be added.

Oh, it's also in Spanish.
