  Sequel to PlaytimeForTheBuck. A filterable games database scraped from Steam and from the Oculus Store. Built in 3 parts: the scrapper, the API and the frontend. It scraped games list, pages and reviews from steam, and video card benchmarks for the system requirements index. Is not offline anymore.
