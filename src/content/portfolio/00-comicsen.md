title: Comicsen
description: My first large project. I was really into web comics at the time. It was a comics translation and publishing platform, with a canvas-based editor that allowed to erase text and write translated text. It worked well but I didn't commit to actually produce content and share the site afterwards. The code was lost; this was before Github.
