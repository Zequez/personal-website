title: Playtime For The Buck
description: '
I wanted to answer this question: given the playtime information on Steam reviews, and knowing the price of games; what is the playtime-for-the-buck index for all games? Anyway, I built a scraper that run on my local machine and generated a static JSON file that was then used on a frontend to create a filterble table. All running on Github pages without a backend.
